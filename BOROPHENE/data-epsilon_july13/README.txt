These two folders contain data files for 2-atom and 5-atom boron structures.

Folder names refer to strain applied along x and y axes, respectively. 
For example, m63=(-6,3), where 6% compressive strain is applied along x-axis and 3% tensile strain is along y-axis.

In these simulations I had 12 Angstroms of vacuum.

Email from Mila:

"thank you for agreeing to help us with the calculations. I added a zipped folder with data files. "epsi.dat" and "epsr.dat" are the imaginary and real parts of the dielectric function. Folder titles refer to value of strain, for example, "m36" means 3% compressive strain along x-axis and 6% tensile strain along y-axis, or (-3,6).

Enclosed folder contain data computed for 3% strain increments, but it would be enough to do the simulations for unstrained and 6%-strained structures (like we did for band structure plots)."

Sahar Email:  

"I also wanted to ask you 1) whether you would be interested in working with us on this other paper to calculate reflectivity for maybe not all 50 but about 20 structures under strain; or 2) if you are unable to, which is very understandable, can you recommend a simple analytical model for us to use to calculate reflectivity? If you are able to work on this, would you be able to start with calculations for 3 structures that result in serious changes to the spectra such as (-6,0), (0,0) and (+6,0) in Figure 7? "
